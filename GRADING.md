Passes all tests - good job!

Take a look at your build output. It’s usually best practice to remove all warnings from your code and the warning listed 
(warning: comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions) is pretty easy to fix if you use a size_t variable instead of a variable of integer type. 

Map_bench works correctly. 

Good explanation of the tradeoffs for the “best” implementation. Graphs are complete and formatted well.

Overall, great job!
